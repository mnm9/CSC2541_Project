# CSC2541_Project
This project is requirement for course CSC2541 - Topics in Machine Learning: Machine Learning for Health at University of Toronto and is in collaboration with Emory University. <br>
The objective of the project is to classify brands of cervical spine implants using X-ray images.<br>
Two separate models were built for classifying anterior hardware and posterior hardware respectively.<br><br>

Anterior Hardware Brands: Atlantis[0], Archon[1], Maxan[2], Helix[3], Zevo[3]<br>
Posterior Hardware Brands: Mountaineer[0], Arch[1], Vertex[2], Virage[3], Oasys[3], Centerpiece/Vertex[3]<br><br>

Following notebooks can be found in folders below:<br>
1) **preprocessing**: Data preprocessing and exploration<br>
2) **shallow_ML**: Linear regression and XGBoost models<br>
3) **pure_pretrained**: ResNet transfer learning <br>
4) **data_centered**: Transfer learning with more complex augmentation like cropping<br>
5) **multiview_basic**: Appending view features<br>
6) **multiview_advanced**: AuxLoss, HEMIS<br>
7) **interpretability**: Gradient based & Occlusion base attribution to interpred multiview_basic models
